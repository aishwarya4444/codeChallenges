Ques 1:
Given a start and end point in snakes and ladders game, find the minimum number of dice rolls needed to reach end. You can assume the necessary input in any format you want.
Wrote code for BFS approach.
Time Complexity: I mentioned O(6^h) where h is the minimum number of moves, while most online resources mention O(n).
