For DAG i.e. "Directed Acyclic Graph" - we can think of topological order
Any "Directed Cyclic Graph" can be converted to DAG using Kosaraju Algorithm

When we talk about DP, some order has to be there.
So, Directed Cyclic Graph has to be converted to DAG.
Bitmasking can be used if number of nodes is less.
