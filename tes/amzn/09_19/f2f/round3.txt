Part1:
Past experience.
Kind of work that I have done.
Drill down in my recent work.
Any feature that I would incorporate if I were a PM? Why that feature.

Part2:
Design PVR cinemas.
Started with a simple use case that user logs in/ searches for movie/ books a ticket.
On whiteboard, I started drawing diagram of various parts of system.
Then I was asked about low level design, how would the database look like.
