Design notification service. Send messages via email, SMS etc. Clients are say Amazon and Swiggy.

Started drawing a simple diagram.
CLIENTS ....... API/ Load Balancer/ Microservice ..... email/ SMS .... end user
Drilled down into each part slowly.
Why am I using API if there is only 1 service? I said in future I can have other services such as login service.
Then added login service.
How will user details be stored?
How will you intimate client about failed notifications. I said we'll keep backup of all messages.
Structure of backup messages table.
Endpoints for each client can be given, where they can see failed notifications.
Sample request and response.
Decouple critical components.
Why use kafka for message queuing, any other alternative?
